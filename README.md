Using the CDC PRAMStat 2011 dataset, we are looking at infant morbidity/mortality and maternal smoking behavior.
The analysis consists of looking at three indicators of infant morbidity/mortality (birth weight, ICU, and whether still alive), comparing smokers and non-smokers (determined 3 months prior to pregnancy and during the last 3 months of pregnancy).
